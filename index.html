                        To pay, either run the black magnetic strip on the back of your card through the card machine or insert the square smart chip (if your card and the merchant use chips). You may need to sign for the transaction, although that’s optional with some small sales and online purchases. In some establishments, you pay with your debit card by handing it to an employee who runs it through a card reader for you.

                                If you're paying for something online, you can typically use your debit card just like a credit card. You don't need to specify that you want to use a debit card (just select the "pay with credit card" option). Start by indicating the type of card you have—Visa or MasterCard, for example. Then, type in the 16-digit number on the front of your debit card. You usually also have to enter the expiration date, which you can find after the words "good through" or "valid through."

                                You may also need to provide a CCD, CVV, or similar security code. Those three-or four-digit codes help to prove that you are authorized to use the card. Those codes can be found on the back of most cards toward the far right (often printed on the card in black ink after your card number). After the authorization, the page will be redirected and you will need to enter an OTP (one-time password), which will be sent to your registered mobile number. In this mode of payment, the transaction will be successful if you have sufficient funds in your bank account.

                          UPI stands for Unified Payment Interface (UPI). It allows the transfer of money from one bank account to another instantly via one's mobile phone. Payments can be made via the app on a mobile device only. The money transfer via UPI works on a 24x7 basis.

                                  To use UPI, you must have a bank account with a member bank, i.e., your bank should allow you to use the UPI facility. Some of the member banks include the State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, etc.

                                Once you have checked whether your bank supports UPI payments, you need to download the UPI payment supporting app on your smartphone. Some of the commonly used apps offering payment via the UPI method are BHIM, which NPCI develops, and there are some private players as well, such as Paytm, PhonePe, Google Pay, Amazon Pay, etc. Remember, your mobile number must be registered with your bank account for the purpose of verification.
